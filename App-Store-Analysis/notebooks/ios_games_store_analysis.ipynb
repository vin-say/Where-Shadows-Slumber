    "## Motivation\n",
    "Proper audience targeting is a critical component of a successful advertising campaign. This study aims to identify customer demographics that may be particularly receptive to Game Revenant's (GR) advertising, specifically to optimize social media-based campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to their large reach and popularity, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can be an effective means of reaching new audiences. Facebook (which own Instagram) and Twitter both offer APIs that allow businesses to target their advertisements based on a number of demographic features, such as age, gender, language, location, and interests. There are a few differences in the targeting options available between Facebook and Twitter. Facebook can target by profession and behavior, while Twitter can target based on a list of Twitter profiles. [fill in\n",
    "\n",
    "here we target based on interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis is performed on unstructured social media data, specifically from Twitter. Compared to other social media, Twitter's API allows greater access to user data, enabling more effective data mining. GR currently has too few followers on Twitter to allow for productive data mining. However, the Twitter accounts of rival companies can be analyzed as well. Where Shadows Slumber (WSS) is frequently compared to Monument Valley, a mobile puzzle game produced by USTWO Games, by game critics and customer reviewers. As of this writing, @ustwogames has over 126k followers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer interests were estimated by 1) examining the profile description of @ustogames followers, and 2) examining the most popular friends among @ustogames followers. Preprocessed descriptions were examined via two clustering approches, K-modes and DBSCAN. In Twitter's official terminology, a 'friend' is an account a user follows. The most popular friends were clustered via K-modes. The rationale behind the unorthodox application of K-modes will be explained later in the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiles of games on the iTunes App Store (https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/ios-games/id6014) were scraped using the python package Scrapy. Game profiles were stored in a SQLite database, in a table named after the genre section they were scrapped from. Note that a game can appear in multiple genre sections. The web scraping code may be found in []."
